First of all, I would like to thank CodeSaya which has opened a free python learning class for students like me, so that I can learn and know how to write correct python code, recognize variables, conditions and control flow, functions and modules, lists and dicts, and much more.

Me and some of my friends, Ridwan, Davi, and Daniel Misael,
a few days ago had the opportunity to learn and work on python practice questions on CodeSaya, initially we were instructed by our Prakerin (Industrial Work Practice) place to learn python programming language, to support our operations in companies that use Odoo Software as one of the main applications that we use daily.

I, Ridwan, Davi, and Daniel, were recommended to learn on the CodeSaya platform by the company where we did our internship.
